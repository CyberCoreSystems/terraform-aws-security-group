# Security Group with Rule Presets

[![IaC Bazaar: live-tested](https://www.iac-bazaar.com/api/artifacts/aws-security-group/badge)](https://www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/aws-security-group?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=artifact)

Security groups with named rule presets (https, postgres, redis...) using modern standalone rule resources.

This module was **applied to a real AWS account, verified, and destroyed** on 2026-06-11 - not just `terraform validate`d.

Check it yourself, no account needed:

```
curl -s https://www.iac-bazaar.com/api/artifacts/aws-security-group/verification
```

The receipt names every check that ran, when it ran, and the SHA-256 of the
archive it describes. Full detail: [www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/aws-security-group](https://www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/aws-security-group)

## Usage

```hcl
module "security_group" {
  source  = "registry.terraform.io/CyberCoreSystems/security-group/aws"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  # See variables.tf for the full input contract.
}
```

## Why this module

Every module we publish goes through the same checks before release:

| check | what it means |
|---|---|
| `tofu validate` + `tflint` | it parses and lints clean |
| `checkov` | scanned for insecure defaults |
| **live test** | **really applied to a cloud account, outputs verified, then destroyed** |

That last row is the one most module catalogues skip. A module that has never
been applied has never been proven.

## Provider compatibility

```
aws >= 6.0, < 7.0
```
